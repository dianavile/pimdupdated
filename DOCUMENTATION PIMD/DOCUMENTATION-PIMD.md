# Intro: What is PIMD

__PIMD__
stands for __“Processing Instructions for Markdown”__.

It is the base for the JavaScript version of [LivingStyleGuide](https://github.com/livingstyleguide/livingstyleguide) – an API to extend Markdown by DOM manipulations as known from the browsers.

The PIMD API, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hagenburger/pimd), helps developers to create front-end style guides easily with SaSS and Markdown.
  
Here are the main things you can do with PIMD:

- __Easy to use in JavaScript projects__ – in build tools and within the browser
- __Extendible__: The main API is the [DOM tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) known from the browser
- __Compliance with CommonMark specs__ – Markdown files render perfectly on GitHub;
- all additional commands will be [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) compliant and won’t leave ugly artifacts when used in README.md files on GitHub
